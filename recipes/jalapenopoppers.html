    <h2>Easy, Delicious Jalapeño Poppers</h2>
    <p><strong>Your family is going to love these!</strong> These jalapeño popper bites are quick and easy to make, and have been a complete hit every time I bring them to a get together with friends or family. I'm confident you will see the same result!</p>
    <p>One of my favorite aspects is you can make these right before you eat them, or make the "filling" ahead of time and put it in the fridge. You begin by browning a tube of sausage on the stove. Drain the pan and set it to the side. Then, soften a brick of cream cheese, and dice up some jalapeños. If you want the jalapeño flavor without the heat, go ahead and wash the seeds off. That's what I do, because I can't handle the heat! In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, sausage, diced jalapeños, and permesan cheese. Preheat the oven to 350, and lay out your tortilla chip scoops onto a baking pan. Using two spoons, add your the mixture into each of the scoops. Put the pan in the oven for 20 minutes, and you're done! Easy as can be. This will quickly become your go-to appetizer!  </p>
