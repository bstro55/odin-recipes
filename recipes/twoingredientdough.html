    <h2>Healthy, Quick Two Ingredient Dough</h2>
    <p>This is called <strong><em>Magical Dough</em></strong> for a reason! Made popular by Weight Watchers, this is truly a magical recipe. It's quick, it's healthy, and most importantly, it's DELICIOUS!</p>
    <p>This dough requires two, yes TWO, ingredients to make. Fat free greek yogurt, and self-rising flour. You simply start by combining and equal mixture of the two, and start to knead together. I like to do it right on my countertop! It cleans up nice and easy.</p>
    <p>As the dough starts to form, you can add more flour if it starts to get "sticky", or more yogurt if it feels too dry. Continuously fold, knead, and roll the rough until it forms a soft, but intact ball of dough. When you're done, you can use your imagination for what to create with your wonderful concoction! Pretzels, bagels, pizza crust... you name it, you can make it!</p>
